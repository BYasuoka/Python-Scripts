This is my attempt at learning Tkinter for Python and making my first GUI by "Scratch". 

I have a few different GUI windows that can populate and plan to keep expanding them as I learn more about Tkinter
1. Main Window aka Root: This is a password window asking you to type the pasword in/siging in to your account essentially. This works on showing text aka a label, entry box for the user and also a button to sign in. With that Sign In Button it also allows for the user to use the enter button as a submit button but it checks to see if the user has entered anything into the entry box.
   1. Account Balance: This is the sub window of the main window once you sign in. It works on using a button to populate a label aka the account balance
3. Open Folder: Found in the menu at the top of the users screen they can open a new window that will guide them in the process of finding a folder that they want the code to save the file path to. This will be directly used in the GUI for other projects so I felt like this was a key feature to learn.
