# Python-Scripts

This Repository contains all of my Python Scripts that I have created since I first started learning how to code Python. I initially first learned in CS 150B which is Intro to Python course offered at CSU.
After that I have leveraged python to get me a job in a research lab and also have used in coursework when processing data.
