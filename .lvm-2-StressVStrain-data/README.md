This is my MECH 331 LabView .lvm converter. 

MECH 331 is a materials course at CSU where we learn how to use labview and run tests like tensile data tests. 

With our specific tensile data collecter here at CSU I have created a script that will take a folder full of .lvm files and convert them to csv then to excel and finally into an excel file that we care about. 
What this means is that each sample has multiple trials lets say Heat treated 1 we have 3 samples for this specific material. Well I have created a way to compile all of this data together within one excel sheet so it can easily be graphed all on one graph.
